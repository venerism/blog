 <p>I have been working on Manila’s traffic congestion problem for quite some time now and honestly,
   based on working on my literary thing (I don’t even know the official name of the project)
   it is hard to grasp on this topic because of how difficult the solution is. Metro Manila
   (and almost all major cities in developing countries) has been battling this issue for decades.
   I have found a book called The Cities of the Poor: Settlement Planning in Developing Countries
   by Alan Turner; It showcases a case study about the assistance program that would help fix the housing problem and the traffic congestion. The problem is that happened in
   the Philippines decades ago (circa: 1970). If they have been battling this problem before,
   how can I even scratch this behemoth of a problem?</p>

<p> It got me thinking. Should I continue with this topic? Is it too late for me to change my subject? I really want to Manila citizens about this problem.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, I went to a Facebook event. Somehow, whatever the panels talked about got me thinking about my topic.
    Man, I am really struggling to work on this project because my interest is slowly dissolving (and its not stopping by any means).
    Last night after the event, I got home and I had a mini epiphany.
    What about a topic about family? Something that has to do with connecting family members in a deeper level.
    Not emotionally but things such as, planning events, chore organisation, family diet, pitching for a vacation, reminders and etc. Side note: what really resonated from the Facebook event is a quote one panel said: “creating a product for everyone but it feels like its tailored for an individual” that shit really hit a home run to me.</p>

  <p>I made a conclusion that I will continue working on my original topic. However, after i complete my literary review and possibly start on my design proposal. I will figure out if I can branch off to another topic that I find interesting. Basically, I will write a summary of my hobbies and interests and maybe find out from there what I truly want to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I like sneakers, photography, I love to travel and I wear hats all the time (lol I feel so basic after writing that).</li>
  <li>I like organising, interior design and I am a strong believer of function over everything.</li>
  <li>I like to drink wine and craft beer but any kind of beer is good too, as long as its not those cheap beer like Pabst or Lakeport. Coors light and Canadian are acceptable at certain occasions.</li>
  <li>I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and play basketball once a week, I try to be as active as I can.</li>
  <li>I try to eat healthy and I recently started counting calories. If I could bike to school, to the mall, to restaurants I would. I would also like to skate again (skateboard).</li>
  <li>I am interested about the future. I always ponder what life would be like 50,100,200,1000 years from now. Movies like blade runner, prometheus, interstellar and other movies in the same genre of sci-fi, thriller interest me.
</li>
  <li>I like to shop and I love to find deals online. it is a nasty habit of mine but I can’t help it. If i find a pair of sneakers thats 40% off in my size and its the last pair, I am buying it with no hesitation.
</li>
<li>I love drinking coffee, although I am not a coffee snob who only drinks coffee from expensive coffee machines (I am guilty of owning a $600 espresso machine, still considered cheap in the coffee world, but yeah.) or only drink pour overs and aero press. However, ever since I have experienced living in Europe, I don’t think I can ever drink Tim Hortons or McDonalds coffee ever again.  </li>
<li>I love building things on the internet. I remember prototyping a website with a powerpoint in elementary school and I didn’t even know that prototyping existed at that time. </li>
</ul>

  <h2>POST 04</h2>
  <p>DISCLAIMER: poorly written. this post is very informal.</p>
  <p>Like my previous idea (Manila’s traffic congestion), my intent is to help the people who I know in the most minuscule possible way, but over time, I want it to affect them strongly to a point that they kind of depend on in their daily life. The reason why I am abandoning my original idea is because I want to tackle on a challenge that I have to deal with in my everyday life. Manila’s traffic congestion does not really affect my life other than the times I visit the city. My new direction is exploring how to manage our family members from within in a micro and macro level.</p>
<p>How this idea came to be is simple, I was at home and my siblings and I were fighting over who’s turn it was to take out the garbage. It got me thinking, if there was a centralised system where we can record and schedule or family life, things would be much easier. It’s not all about managing chores either. My family usually chips in for presents, it would be a nice idea if theres a way where we can all put in money in one single app. I agree, its much easier to e-transfer, but I think using the e-transfer isn’t the end of it all. I believer theres a way to make it much easier. (this type of system can also work for a group of friends)</p>
<p>I try to stay active and I try to eat healthy. I try to influence my family members as much as possible as well. And they do, they truly try but I think a better way to manage our eating habits could be managed a better way.
Recently, I checked out family fridge and our pantry and I noticed a lot of food turning into waste because of the abundance of food we own.
(it would be a cool idea to have a voting system what we are having for dinner on a Friday night)</p>
<p>Vacation is a big part of my family. We try to fly out once a year (I fly twice a year) and it would be awesome if we can all pitch in to a family vacation in a more organised manner. This idea branched of and I thought of a more bigger solution. What about a financial feature where we pay off all our bills within the family? like for example, car insurance, phone bill, or etc. what about a feature like a swear jar? family members put in a small amount into the saving jar. </p>
<p>I know this is bad but, I see the potential in this project to be actually placed into real life. this system would gather data and sell them to big companies. I mean personally, I see no harm to it. Why would I keep it a secret what my family eats every week?</p>
