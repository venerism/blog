 <p>I have been working on Manila’s traffic congestion problem for quite some time now and honestly,
   based on working on my literary thing (I don’t even know the official name of the project)
   it is hard to grasp on this topic because of how difficult the solution is. Metro Manila
   (and almost all major cities in developing countries) has been battling this issue for decades.
   I have found a book called The Cities of the Poor: Settlement Planning in Developing Countries
   by Alan Turner; It showcases a case study about the assistance program that would help fix the housing problem and the traffic congestion. The problem is that happened in
   the Philippines decades ago (circa: 1970). If they have been battling this problem before,
   how can I even scratch this behemoth of a problem?</p>

<p> It got me thinking. Should I continue with this topic? Is it too late for me to change my subject? I really want to Manila citizens about this problem.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, I went to a Facebook event. Somehow, whatever the panels talked about got me thinking about my topic.
    Man, I am really struggling to work on this project because my interest is slowly dissolving (and its not stopping by any means).
    Last night after the event, I got home and I had a mini epiphany.
    What about a topic about family? Something that has to do with connecting family members in a deeper level.
    Not emotionally but things such as, planning events, chore organisation, family diet, pitching for a vacation, reminders and etc. Side note: what really resonated from the Facebook event is a quote one panel said: “creating a product for everyone but it feels like its tailored for an individual” that shit really hit a home run to me.</p>

  <p>I made a conclusion that I will continue working on my original topic. However, after i complete my literary review and possibly start on my design proposal. I will figure out if I can branch off to another topic that I find interesting. Basically, I will write a summary of my hobbies and interests and maybe find out from there what I truly want to do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I like sneakers, photography, I love to travel and I wear hats all the time (lol I feel so basic after writing that).</li>
  <li>I like organising, interior design and I am a strong believer of function over everything.</li>
  <li>I like to drink wine and craft beer but any kind of beer is good too, as long as its not those cheap beer like Pabst or Lakeport. Coors light and Canadian are acceptable at certain occasions.</li>
  <li>I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and play basketball once a week, I try to be as active as I can.</li>
  <li>I try to eat healthy and I recently started counting calories. If I could bike to school, to the mall, to restaurants I would. I would also like to skate again (skateboard).</li>
  <li>I am interested about the future. I always ponder what life would be like 50,100,200,1000 years from now. Movies like blade runner, prometheus, interstellar and other movies in the same genre of sci-fi, thriller interest me.
</li>
  <li>I like to shop and I love to find deals online. it is a nasty habit of mine but I can’t help it. If i find a pair of sneakers thats 40% off in my size and its the last pair, I am buying it with no hesitation.
</li>
<li>I love drinking coffee, although I am not a coffee snob who only drinks coffee from expensive coffee machines (I am guilty of owning a $600 espresso machine, still considered cheap in the coffee world, but yeah.) or only drink pour overs and aero press. However, ever since I have experienced living in Europe, I don’t think I can ever drink Tim Hortons or McDonalds coffee ever again.  </li>
<li>I love building things on the internet. I remember prototyping a website with a powerpoint in elementary school and I didn’t even know that prototyping existed at that time. </li>
</ul>
