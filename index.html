   <h2> POST 01</h2>
 <p>I have been working on Manila’s traffic congestion problem for quite some time now and honestly,
   based on working on my literary thing (I don’t even know the official name of the project)
   it is hard to grasp on this topic because of how difficult the solution is. Metro Manila
   (and almost all major cities in developing countries) has been battling this issue for decades.
   I have found a book called The Cities of the Poor: Settlement Planning in Developing Countries
   by Alan Turner; It showcases a case study about the assistance program that would help fix the housing problem and the traffic congestion. The problem is that happened in
   the Philippines decades ago (circa: 1970). If they have been battling this problem before,
   how can I even scratch this behemoth of a problem?</p>

<p> It got me thinking. Should I continue with this topic? Is it too late for me to change my subject? I really want to Manila citizens about this problem.</p>

  <p>Yesterday, I went to a Facebook event. Somehow, whatever the panels talked about got me thinking about my topic.
    Man, I am really struggling to work on this project because my interest is slowly dissolving (and its not stopping by any means).
    Last night after the event, I got home and I had a mini epiphany.
    What about a topic about family? Something that has to do with connecting family members in a deeper level.
    Not emotionally but things such as, planning events, chore organisation, family diet, pitching for a vacation, reminders and etc. Side note: what really resonated from the Facebook event is a quote one panel said: “creating a product for everyone but it feels like its tailored for an individual” that shit really hit a home run to me.</p>

  <p>I made a conclusion that I will continue working on my original topic Manila’s Vehicle Density Issue.
    I will finish the Literary Review and Think of a Design Proposal. By the end of the day I will list 2 other topics that I am interested in and then start on working on that.
    Hopefully finish the first few parts of the project.</p>
