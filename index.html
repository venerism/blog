 <p>I have been working on Manila’s traffic congestion problem for quite some time now and honestly, based on working on my literary thing (I don’t even know the official name of the project) it is hard to grasp on this topic because of how difficult the solution is. Metro Manila (and almost all major cities in developing countries) has been battling this issue for decades. I have found a book called The Cities of the Poor: Settlement Planning in Developing Countries by Alan Turner; It showcases a case study about the assistance program that happened in the Philippines decades ago (circa: 1970). If they have been battling this problem before, how can I even scratch
this behemoth of a problem?</p>

<p> It got me thinking. Should I continue with this topic? Is it too late for me to change my subject? I really want to Manila citizens about this problem. </p>
