<h1> Project 01: Expanding The Post Purhcase Experience</h1>

<h2> DESIGN BRIEF: OVERVIEW</h2>

<p>It’s no question that persuading consumers to purchase products and services is the main focus in marketing (duh). There are countless of strategies, research, techniques, and etc on how to sell goods. Now with that being said, let’s step back and give this a little quick thought: How come there’s not a lot of focus on the post purchase experience? It seems to me—though my personal experience—that there isn’t a lot of T.L.C. (tender, love and care) after we give our money away to these companies. Why so?
</p>

<p>One of the biggest things that we should consider exploring is the post purchase dissonance or also known as “buyer’s remorse” according to this random article I found on google, buyer’s remorse is essentially a post purchase phase when a customer’s mind is on a state of “doubt”, “guilt” and question their recent purchase. Usually, this displeasurable  experience happens when a big purchase is made—unless you’re extremely frugal that you get buyer’s remorse for buying french fries or something.
</p>

<p>Looking back to our question before, how do we decrease this feeling? Is there a way to keep consumers happy after a purchase? And the answer is yes, of course there are. Tons of them actually. But right now, let’s focus on the online shopping experience because after you click that confirm order button, there really isn’t anything we can do other than check on that tracking shipment page every 2 hours.</p>

<p>I read a very interesting article on the Shopify blog about how our brains go through a dual process. It is a theory that our minds go into two different systems of thinking; the first system is our emotional rationality (it usually hits us quick and hard) and right after that is the logical system. Let me explain, for example, when we are buying a product—let’s say a pair of shoes, we get trigged emotionally. We get excited, we get visually simulated, and etc. After all that rollercoaster of euphoric blast of dopamine thinking about how fire those shoes are going to look on your feet, and all of a sudden, our minds says: “hold on, what about your rent? I swear, did you just buy a pair of shoes last week? Like dude, they’re not even that lit though”. This dual process is how we decide if we should buy a product or not—sort of like that classical imagery of an angel and a devil arguing over your shoulder.</p>
